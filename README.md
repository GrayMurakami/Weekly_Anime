# Weekly Anime

**Weekly Anime** is a simple project that displays anime releases for the current week.  
Built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** like a landing page standart.

## Preview

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a small local static server for a smoother experience:

```bash
# Option 1: using npx (Node.js required)
npx http-server .

# Option 2: using VS Code Live Server
# Right-click index.html → “Open with Live Server”

Then visit: http://localhost:8080 (or the port shown in your terminal).
```
